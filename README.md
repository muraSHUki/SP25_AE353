# Veranga et al. AE353 Design Projects

This repository contains the code, documentation, and final reports for the **AE 353 Design Projects** completed in the course **AE353: Aerospace Control Systems** taught by [Professor Timothy Bretl](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tbretl) during the Spring 2025 semester at the Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The project requirements, deliverables, and code outlines were provided by the course instructor and can be found on the [course website](https://tbretl.github.io/ae353-sp25/) and the [respective git page](https://github.com/tbretl/ae353-sp25). The goal for each project was to design a controller solution, implement it in code, analyze the results, and present subsequent findings in a formal report.

## Project Overviews

1. **Cat-Bot:** A wheeled robot that balances to stand upright and catch test-pilots (cats).
    - Partner: Ella Young (ellamy2@illinois.edu)
2. **Zagi:** A fixed-wing aircraft, resembling the “Zagi” flying wing, that lands safely on a floating runway with its test-pilot (a cat).
    - Partner: Luke Ficalora (lukeaf3@illinois.edu)
3. **Spacecraft:** A spacecraft that maintains a fixed orientation while being disrupted by debris so that an astronaut (i.e., a space cat) can safely dock and re-enter the spacecraft through a hatch.
